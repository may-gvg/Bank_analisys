As a member of the board I am interested in the following information in order to make key strategic decisions for our company:

1. How much percent of the total deposit do the 1% of institutes with highest deposits have?  

2. Visualize banking department (REGNANT) distribution on a piechart.

3. Visualize total deposits (DEPSUMBR) per banking department (REGNANT).

4. Visualize total deposits (DEPSUMBR) per state, city in Tableau.

5. Clusterize institutes by GCD (Geographic Coordinate System) and visualize in Tableau
